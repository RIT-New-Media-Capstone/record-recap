# Record Recap
### Jordan, Nihal, Judy

## Our Project
An application that records audio from the user and returns a partially customized text summary of it.
The user can change the length (short, medium, long), the style (regular, rap, Yoda), and the format (paragraph, bullet point) of the summary.
The audio doesn't have to be re-recorded every time the user wants a new styled summary.
